Welcome to the company! This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment.

**1. Install Git:**

**2. Install Docker:**

*   Download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

**3. Install Python:**

*   We use Python 3.8 for most of our projects. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/).

**4. Install Node.js:**

*   We use Node.js version 16. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.0.0).

### Requesting Cloud Resources

To get access to our cloud resources, you'll need to use our internal tool, `CloudProvisioner`.

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Run the following command to request developer access for a general project:

    ```bash
    cprov request --role=developer --project=general
    ```
