# Troubleshooting Local Setup

This is a living document to help with common local setup issues.

**Q: I'm getting an error with the `cprov` command in the Project Nexus guide.**

**A:** The Project Nexus guide is outdated. Use the command from the main Company Handbook: `cprov request --role=developer --project=general`. We need to get someone to update that Nexus doc.

**Q: Which version of Python should I use?**

**A:** The handbook says 3.8, but for Project Nexus, you'll need 3.9 because of a dependency issue. The handbook is more for general projects.
